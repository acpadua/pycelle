# pycelle
Pycelle is code that can be used to detect and quantify round bright regions in an image with a dark background. In the image, each stain/dot corresponds to a certain element that the user wants to characterize/quantify. For example, the stains/dots can be starts/galaxies in images captured by telescopes or droplets/micelles/cells in images from microscopes.
